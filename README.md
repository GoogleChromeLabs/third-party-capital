# Third Party Capital

Third Party Capital is a resource that consolidates best practices for loading popular third-parties in a single place.

## Rationale

There is a large, cross-functional Chrome initiative that aims to improve third-party resource loading on the web. One part of this effort is to provide a default set of recommendations, or "components," to developers. These components will help developers sequence and fetch popular third-party resources at the right time to minimize their overall impact to page performance.

Instead of duplicating these recommendations in multiple places and expecting maintainers for each tool to keep them up to date, Third Party Capital consolidates them in a single repository with an API. This API makes it possible for consumers to import the recommendations directly within their tooling.
